                        <p>Cryptocurrency existed as a theoretical construct long before the first digital alternative currencies debuted.</p>
                        <p>Early cryptocurrency proponents shared the goal of applying cutting-edge mathematical and computer science principles to solve what they perceived as practical and political shortcomings of “traditional” fiat currencies.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Before Bitcoin</h2>
                        <p>Cryptocurrency’s technical foundations date back to the early 1980s when an American cryptographer named David Chaum invented a “blinding” algorithm that remains central to modern web-based encryption.</p>
                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                        <p>About 15 years later, an accomplished software engineer named Wei Dai published a white paper on b-money, a virtual currency architecture that included many of the basic components of modern cryptocurrencies, such as complex anonymity protections and decentralization.</p>
                        <p>However, b-money was never deployed as a means of exchange.</p>
                        <p>The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the rise of more conventional digital finance intermediaries.</p>
                        <p>Chief among them was PayPal, which made Tesla founder and noted cryptocurrency advocate Elon Musk’s first fortune and proved to be a harbinger of today’s mobile payment technologies that have exploded in popularity over the past 10 years.</p>
                        <p>But no true cryptocurrency emerged until the late 2000s when Bitcoin came onto the scene.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Bitcoin and the Modern Cryptocurrency Boom</h2>
                        <p>Bitcoin is widely regarded as the first modern cryptocurrency — the first publicly used means of exchange to combine decentralized control, user anonymity, record-keeping via a blockchain, and built-in scarcity.</p>
                        <p>It was first outlined in a 2008 white paper published by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or group.</p>
                        <p>In early 2009, Nakamoto released Bitcoin to the public, and a group of enthusiastic supporters began exchanging and mining the currency.</p>
                        <p>By late 2010, the first of what would eventually be dozens of similar cryptocurrencies — including popular alternatives like Litecoin — began appearing. The first public Bitcoin exchanges appeared around this time as well.</p>
                        <p>In late 2012, WordPress became the first major merchant to accept payment in Bitcoin. Others, including online electronics retailer Newegg.com, Expedia, Microsoft, and Tesla followed. Countless merchants now view the world’s most popular cryptocurrency as a legitimate payment method.</p>
                        <p>And new cryptocurrency applications take root with impressive frequency — Cryptomaniaks has a great look at the fast-growing world of cryptocurrency sports betting sites as just one example.</p>
                        <p>Although few cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are widely accepted for merchant payments, increasingly active exchanges allow holders to exchange them for Bitcoin or fiat currencies — providing critical liquidity and flexibility. Since the late 2010s, big business and institutional investors have closely watched what they call the “crypto space” too.</p>
                        <p>Facebook’s closely guarded Libra project could be the first true cryptocurrency alternative to fiat currencies, although its growing pains suggest that true parity remains well in the future.</p>
