                        <p>eSports is growing in popularity and scale at an unprecedented rate. Now even entire stadiums are being built just to host eSports tournaments.  Cyber athletes even rival professional athletes for earnings, spectatorship, and the accompanying worship of their talents. But how do gamers make the transition from amateurs to professionals? Let’s take a look at what it takes to be the best.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What’s It All About?</h2>
                        <p>Simply the short name for electronic sports, eSports have all the competitiveness of traditional sports, but from the comfort of a chair. They come with most of the challenges too, such as grueling training regimes and fierce competition needed to make it to the limelight. For example, this year’s eFIFA will pit 32 individual players against each other in the knockout tournament, and each of those players had to overcome 20 million competitors to make it to the eFIFA final!</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, eSports has mostly shed its past difficulties in not being recognized on the level of pro sports, with the serious possibility of making it into the Olympic Games. These days, turning professional has become as realistic an option as it is for sports.</p>
                        <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote">About 15 years later, an accomplished software engineer named Wei Dai published a white paper on b-money, a virtual currency architecture that included many of the basic components of modern cryptocurrencies, such as complex anonymity protections and decentralization.</blockquote> -->
                        <p>Many high-profile tournaments for games like League of Legends, DOTA, Starcraft 2, and along with first-person shooters like Overwatch, have become incredibly popular to watch. In some cases, pulling in up to 80 million live viewers. With mass spectatorship comes serious sponsorship and big prize pools. As an impressive example, the upcoming DOTA 2 International has a current prize pool of $24m and counting, all contributed by fans of the game.</p>
                        <p>This success is spurring many young and upcoming gamers to dream of becoming professionals as a long-term career. But as we will see, becoming the next big star in eSports needs a hell of a lot of dedication, talent, and then some.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Recipe for Success</h2>
                        <p>As it might not be what you’d expect, let’s run through the ingredients that make up an elite eSports athlete.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Commitment</h2>
                        <p>To casual gamers, the idea of playing their favorite as much as they like might seem pretty cushy. Not the case. For most part, it’s not about fun, but rather blood, sweat and tears. Determination to undergo exhausting training, day in day out, year after year, is a crucial requirement. For example, recent rumors suggested that some Overwatch League players train 10-16 hours a day in preparation for competition. Martin "Rekkles" Larsson, who plays for UK-based organization Fnatic agreed more generally, saying,</p>
                        <p>“Players are required to put in many, many hours in order to reach - and stay at - the top level.”</p>
                        <p>It's not unusual for players to put in 16 hours of practice in a single day.”</p>
                        <p>Overwatch star Isaac Charles (AKA ‘Boombox’) emphasized how under-recognized this level of commitment is,</p>
                        <p>“The thing about being a pro gamer is that it shocks people how much time we put into being the best. We train as hard as other sporting athletes.”.</p>
